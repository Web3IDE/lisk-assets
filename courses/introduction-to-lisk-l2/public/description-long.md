# Introduction to Lisk L2

## Lisk's Role in the Ethereum Ecosystem

Lisk is an L2 network built on top of Ethereum that provides a whole ecosystem of functionalities and applications.

Its **sidechain architecture** enables developers to create their own decentralized applications while making use of the security and interoperability of the main Lisk network. Developers of decentralized applications can create their own sidechains tailored to their specific applications. These sidechains operate independently but can also be designed to interoperate with the Ethereum L1 chain.

The primary programming language on Ethereum is Solidity, which can become a barrier for developers unfamiliar with this language. Lisk, on the other hand, makes use of **JavaScript**, one of the most popular programming languages in the world. This significantly lowers the entry barrier for developers to start building their decentralized applications on Lisk, as they are most likely already familiar with the language.

## Cost Efficiency and Scalability

One of the significant challenges of L1 Ethereum is scalability. With the increasing number of transactions, their cost and time to process also increase. Lisk addresses these issues with its sidechains, allowing for parallel transaction processing on multiple chains.

Lisk’s **sidechains** are blockchains connected to the main Lisk network. This enables developers to build decentralized applications that operate on their own sidechains.

By offloading transactions to sidechains, Lisk effectively decreases the transaction fees and block time compared to the Ethereum L1 network.

Lisk’s architecture also supports interoperability between sidechains, which enables communication and token **transfers between chains** within the Lisk ecosystem.

## History and Mission of Lisk

Lisk was founded in 2016 by Max Kordek and Oliver Beddows, with the mission to make blockchain **more accessible to developers**. The platform was designed to simplify the process of building blockchain applications by providing an SDK (Software Development Kit) in JavaScript, one of the most popular programming languages used by over 15 million developers worldwide.

Since its launch, Lisk has grown into an ecosystem with a wide community of developers and users. The Lisk platform continues to grow with ongoing updates improving its scalability, security, and usability.

## Lisk Infrastructure Partners

The Lisk network is supported by a strong set of partners who provide services and support for the platform. These partners play an important role in maintaining the stability, security, and growth of the ecosystem.

- **Indonesian Ministry of Communications & Informatics**: Through their [1000 Digital Startup Program](https://1000startupdigital.id/), Lisk provides the underlying developer platform, mentorship, and initial grant funding to Web3 startups.

- **Lisk Center**: Lisk Center is a physical hub located in Berlin, Germany. This center serves as a community space where developers, entrepreneurs, and blockchain enthusiasts can collaborate, attend workshops, and learn more about the Lisk platform. You can learn more about it on the [Lisk Center website](https://lisk.com/center).

## Blockchain Applications on Lisk

- **[Lisk DAO](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/lisk)**: A Decentralized Autonomous Organization launched in June 2024 that allows LSK token holders to participate in the governance of the Lisk network. Its members can propose and vote on network upgrades, development initiatives, and funding decisions.

- **[Safe Wallet](https://safe.optimism.io/welcome?chain=lisk)**: A secure and user-friendly wallet application that allows users to interact with their Lisk-based fungible and non-fungible tokens. It also supports multisig, meaning you can set it up in a way that requires a signature from multiple accounts before a transaction is sent, increasing the overall security of your funds.

- **[Block Explorer](https://blockscout.lisk.com/)**: Made by Blockscout, this web-based tool provides detailed insights into transactions, blocks, and other activities on the Lisk chain. You can track your transactions, view block details, and monitor network activity in real-time.

## Getting Started with Lisk L2

Are you ready to start building on Lisk?

You may start with a simple Hello World, or feel free to share a proof of concept of another app that you have built using the Lisk SDK or deployed on the Lisk chain, and send us a GitHub link to your project.

The Lisk core team members will review your submission.
