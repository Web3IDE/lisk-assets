## Hello world

Your code can use as many variables as you wish. Their values can be strings (text), numbers - integers as well as decimal numbers, booleans (`true` or `false`), and many other types.

You can also combine variables together with the plus sign (`+`). Here we have three separate variables: `greeting`, `name`, and `exclamation`. The last variable `message` concatenates them together using the plus sign.

But wait - our code only combines two of them. Not all three.

## Exercise

- The `message` variable now only says `Hello, !`. Update the line so that it says `Hello, World!`.
