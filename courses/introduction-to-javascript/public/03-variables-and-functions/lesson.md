## Variables and functions

It's often useful to structure parts of our code into logical chunks. We can use functions for that.

This example code declares a function `add()` that accepts two parameters - numbers `a` and `b`. The function should calculate a sum of these numbers, store them in the `result` variable, and then `return` the value of the `result` variable.

When a function returns some value, we can assign this returned value to another variable and use it later in our code. In this example, we assign the returned value to the `sum` variable.

Remember the plus sign (`+`) from the previous lesson? You can use it not only to combine text, but also to add numbers. So if we want to calculate the result of adding 1 and 2, we can simply write `1 + 2`. If the values were stored in variables `one` and `two`, we could add them by writing `one + two`.

## Exercise

- Declare the variable `result` and assign its value. Its value should be the sum of variables `a` and `b`.
