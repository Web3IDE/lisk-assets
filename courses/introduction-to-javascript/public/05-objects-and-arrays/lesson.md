## Objects and arrays

Sometimes we want to store groups of data and work with them together. We can use objects and arrays for that.

An **object** can group multiple different properties that share a similar meaning, e.g. they all describe a car. An object that represents a car can have propoerties such as its color, engine power, and number of seats.

A car delaership might want to store information about all their cars. An **array** is a great tool that enables to group multiple variables (they can be objects but also numbers, strings, ...) and work with them together. So when you're buildling an app for this dealearship, you could store their cars in an array and then simply add or remove them from the array when needed.

You can also store user information in objects and arrays. The following example declares an object variable called `john` that represents one of the users. And then we have another variable called `users` - an array that lists two users. But one of the user objects, `bob`, is not yet declared.

## Exercise

- Declare an object variable called `bob`. Assign property values: `firstName` value `Bob`, `lastName` value `Smiths` and `age` value `22`.
