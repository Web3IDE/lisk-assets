## JavaScript basics

JavaScript (sometimes also referred to simply as JS) is a powerful programming language that is used by most websites today. And not only websites - you can also run JavaScript-powered apps on mobile, on servers, and other environments.

Today we're going to dive into introduction to JavaScript. At the end of this course, you'll be able to write your own simple JS application.

Back in the 1990s, when the internet was starting to be recognized by many users, browser developers wanted to enhance the features of the browsers they were building. So they came up with a way to make websites more interactive. A new language that you could integrate into your website as an addition to the static HTML sites.

The name JavaScript is in fact inspired by Java. But just to be clear - Java and JavaScript are two different languages and they serve slightly different purposes.

One of the key concepts of the JS language are variables. Using the keyword `let`, you can declare a variable and assign it some value. For example, here we have a variable called `message` and its value is `Hello, World!`.

You can also see the statement `export` on line 3. This block of code signifies that you want your script to be able to pass data to some other. In this case, we're allowing the `message`  to be passed somewhere else because it's mentioned within the `export` block. And the value of the `message` variable is later read by our other script that validates changes in the code.

## Exercise

- Change the `message` so that it says `Hello, Agorapp!` instead of the original `Hello, World!`
